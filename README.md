## What can I do with the statistics system?

Statistics is a system created to keep track of income and expenses, primarily designed to keep track of business models for link shorteners but can be used and adapted to almost any need for income and money outflow.

With this system, you can:
- Enter, edit, and search previous months.
- View results of the current month vs the previous month.
- View all changes in real-time.
